NikataProject

NikataProject is a proprietary vintage computer operating system–style interface built for the modern web.

It is not a chatbot wrapper or a visual experiment.
It is a system simulation inspired by classic computers seen in films, early scientific terminals, and command-driven personal computers.

The project prioritizes discipline, explicit system behavior, and utility over modern UI conventions.

Purpose

NikataProject exists to explore and deliver:

System-first interaction instead of assistant-style conversation

Command-driven workflows

Explicit state, delay, and failure handling

A focused, distraction-free computing environment

This project is designed to feel like a machine, not a companion.

Core Characteristics

Retro terminal-style interface

Monospace typography and low-color palette

Deterministic, predictable behavior

Keyboard-first operation

Explicit system states (BOOT, LOADING, READY, ERROR)

No emojis, no modern UI metaphors

Every limitation is intentional.

Design Principles

Systems over friendliness
The interface does not simulate human behavior.

Visibility over magic
All state changes are explicit.

Failure is normal
Errors, restrictions, and delays are part of the experience.

Utility before aesthetics
Visual design supports function, not novelty.

Technology Stack

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Minimal CSS / inline styles

State management: React hooks

Audio: HTML Audio API

AI integration: Optional, backend-agnostic

No heavy UI frameworks. No unnecessary abstractions.
